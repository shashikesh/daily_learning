# Agile Development Principles

The following are the key principles of Agile development, based on the **Agile Manifesto**. These principles emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and delivering value to the customer.

## 1. Customer Satisfaction Through Early and Continuous Delivery
Deliver working software frequently, with a focus on providing value early and often.

## 2. Welcoming Changing Requirements
Embrace changes, even late in development, to improve customer outcomes and keep the product relevant.

## 3. Frequent Delivery of Working Software
Deliver smaller increments of functionality regularly, typically in weeks rather than months.

## 4. Collaboration Between Business and Developers
Foster continuous and close cooperation between stakeholders and development teams throughout the project.

## 5. Empower and Trust Motivated Individuals
Build projects around motivated team members, give them the support and trust they need, and encourage self-organization.

## 6. Face-to-Face Communication
Prioritize direct communication (in-person or virtual) as it is the most effective and efficient way to convey information.

## 7. Working Software as the Primary Measure of Progress
Value functional software over extensive documentation as the key measure of success.

## 8. Sustainable Development Pace
Maintain a constant, sustainable pace of work for the team to ensure quality and prevent burnout.

## 9. Continuous Attention to Technical Excellence
Encourage best practices, clean code, and design excellence to maintain quality and agility.

## 10. Simplicity
Focus on maximizing the amount of work not doneâ€”simplify processes and solutions to focus only on what adds value.

## 11. Self-Organizing Teams
Teams should make decisions independently and take ownership of how they work to achieve goals.

## 12. Regular Reflection and Adaptation
Periodically assess team performance (e.g., retrospectives) and adjust practices for continuous improvement.

These principles guide Agile methodologies such as **Scrum**, **Kanban**, and **Extreme Programming (XP)**, enabling teams to remain adaptive, customer-focused, and efficient.
