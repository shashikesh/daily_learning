# Linux File System Overview

The **Linux file system** (FS) organizes files and directories in a hierarchical structure. It follows the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)** and supports multiple file system types.

---

## 1. Key Linux File System Concepts
### 1.1 Files and Directories
- **Everything in Linux is a file**, including directories, devices, and processes.
- Files are stored in a hierarchical structure starting from the root directory `/`.

### 1.2 File System Types
- **ext4** (Fourth Extended File System) â€“ Default in most Linux distros.
- **xfs** â€“ High-performance journaling FS.
- **btrfs** â€“ Advanced FS with snapshots and RAID support.
- **zfs** â€“ Scalable FS with built-in compression and snapshots.
- **NFS** (Network File System) â€“ Allows remote access to files.
- **FAT32, NTFS, exFAT** â€“ Used for Windows compatibility.

## 2. Linux File System Structure

Linux follows a hierarchical directory structure:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/` | Root directory (starting point of FS). |
| `/bin` | Essential binaries (commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`). |
| `/boot` | Boot-related files (kernel, GRUB). |
| `/dev` | Device files (e.g., `/dev/sda` for disks). |
| `/etc` | System configuration files. |
| `/home` | User home directories (`/home/user`). |
| `/lib` | Essential shared libraries. |
| `/media` | Auto-mounted removable media (USB, CD-ROM). |
| `/mnt` | Temporary mount points. |
| `/opt` | Optional software packages. |
| `/proc` | Virtual filesystem for system and process info. |
| `/root` | Root userâ€™s home directory. |
| `/sbin` | System binaries (for system administration). |
| `/srv` | Data for services (e.g., web servers). |
| `/sys` | Virtual FS with system-related info. |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files (cleared on reboot). |
| `/usr` | User applications, libraries, documentation. |
| `/var` | Variable files (logs, cache, databases). |

## 3. File System Operations
### 3.1 Viewing File System Information
- Check mounted file systems:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```
- View file system type:
  ```bash
  lsblk -f
  ```
- Check disk usage:
  ```bash
  du -sh /directory
  ```

### 3.2 Mounting and Unmounting
- Mount a partition:
  ```bash
  mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
  ```
- Unmount:
  ```bash
  umount /mnt
  ```

### 3.3 Creating and Formatting File Systems
- Format a partition as `ext4`:
  ```bash
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
  ```
- Check file system for errors:
  ```bash
  fsck /dev/sdb1
  ```

## 4. Advanced File System Features
### 4.1 Journaling
- Ensures file system integrity in case of crashes (ext3, ext4, xfs).

### 4.2 LVM (Logical Volume Manager)
- Allows flexible disk management:
  ```bash
  lvcreate -L 20G -n myvolume myvg
  ```

### 4.3 RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
- Used for redundancy and performance.

### 4.4 File System Permissions
- View permissions:
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```
- Change permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod 755 file
  ```
- Change ownership:
  ```bash
  chown user:group file
  ```

## 5. Common File Systems in Linux

| File System | Features |
|------------|---------|
| `ext4` | Journaling, large file support, default in Linux. |
| `xfs` | High-performance, used in RHEL/CentOS. |
| `btrfs` | Snapshots, checksums, RAID support. |
| `zfs` | Advanced FS with self-healing and deduplication. |
| `vfat/exFAT` | Used for USB drives (Windows-compatible). |
| `NFS` | Remote file sharing. |

---

## 6. Automounting File Systems
To automatically mount a disk at boot, add an entry in `/etc/fstab`:
```bash
/dev/sdb1  /mnt/data  ext4  defaults  0  2
```
Apply changes:
```bash
mount -a
```

## Conclusion
The Linux file system is powerful and flexible, supporting various file systems, permission management, logical volume management, and advanced features like RAID and snapshots.
