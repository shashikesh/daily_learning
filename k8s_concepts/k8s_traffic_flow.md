# Kubernetes Traffic Flow on GCP with Domain

## **Traffic Flow Overview**
When deploying an application on **Kubernetes (K8s) on GCP** and exposing it through a **domain**, the traffic flow follows these steps:

### **1. User Request to Domain (DNS Resolution)**
- A user enters the domain (e.g., `example.com`) in their browser.
- The request goes to a **DNS server** (like Cloud DNS) to resolve the domain name into an IP address.

### **2. Traffic Reaches Load Balancer (Ingress)**
- The DNS record typically points to a **Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB)**, which routes external traffic to the Kubernetes cluster.
- The Load Balancer is usually created when you define an **Ingress** resource in Kubernetes.

### **3. Ingress Controller Routes Traffic**
- The **Ingress Controller** (e.g., NGINX Ingress, GCE Ingress) processes the request.
- It applies routing rules (e.g., path-based or host-based routing) and forwards traffic to the appropriate **Service** inside the cluster.

### **4. Service Routes to Pods**
- The Kubernetes **Service** (often of type `NodePort` or `ClusterIP`) receives the request from the Ingress.
- It then forwards it to the correct **Pod** running the application via **kube-proxy**.

### **5. Pod Handles Request**
- The application inside the **Pod** processes the request.
- It may interact with **databases, caches, or other microservices** inside the cluster.

### **6. Response Sent Back**
- The processed response travels back through the same flow:
  - **Pod → Service → Ingress → Load Balancer → User**
