Understanding Google Cloud IAM Resources in Terraform
Google Cloud's Terraform provider offers three primary resources for managing IAM policies at the project level: `google_project_iam_policy`, `google_project_iam_binding`, and `google_project_iam_member`. 
### Each has specific use cases and behaviors, as described below.

- ### `google_project_iam_policy`
    - `Purpose`: Manages the entire IAM policy for a project.
    - `Behavior`: Replaces the entire IAM policy for the project with the specified configuration.
Any existing IAM bindings or members not included in the configuration will be removed.
Use Case:
When you need to comprehensively manage the IAM policy for a project.
Suitable for environments where Terraform is the sole manager of IAM policies.  


- ### `google_project_iam_binding`  
    - `Purpose:` Manages a specific IAM binding (a role and its members) for a project.
    - `Behavior:`
    Adds or updates a specific role-member binding.
    Does not affect other bindings in the project.
    - `Use Case:`
    When you want to manage a specific role and its associated members without impacting other roles.
    Ideal for shared environments where multiple teams manage different IAM roles.


- ### `google_project_iam_member`
    - `Purpose`: Manages a single member's role for a project.
    - `Behavior`: Adds or removes a specific member for a specific role.
    Does not affect other members of the role.
    - `Use Case`:
    When you need fine-grained control to grant or revoke access for individual users or service accounts.

#### *Key Differences Summary*
| Resource Type	Scope   |   Behavior |	Use Case|
|-----------------------|---------| ---------|
|`google_project_iam_policy`| Entire IAM policy for the project	Replaces all IAM bindings for the project|	Full control of the projectâ€™s IAM policy|
|`google_project_iam_binding`|	Specific role with a list of members. Manages one role and its members, without affecting other roles| Manage a single role and all its members|
|`google_project_iam_member`| Single member and a single role. Manages access for one member to one role, without affecting others|	Granular control of individual user or service account access|

#### Choosing the Right Resource
- Use `google_project_iam_policy` if:
You want to enforce a strict IAM policy for a project.
No other tools or users are modifying IAM settings outside Terraform.
- Use` google_project_iam_binding` if:
You want to manage specific roles and their members without overwriting unrelated roles.
- Use `google_project_iam_member` if:
You need precise control over individual users or service accounts.
